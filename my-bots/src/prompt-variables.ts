    value: "Hi Dr. Johnson, I hope you're having a good week. I'm writing because I've been having these terrible headaches for about a month now. They usually start right behind my eyes and then spread to the whole front of my head. The pain is really intense, like someone's squeezing my brain, and it makes it hard to focus on anything. I work as an accountant, so I'm looking at screens all day, which seems to make it worse. The headaches come on almost every day, usually in the afternoon, and last for several hours. I've been taking over-the-counter painkillers, usually two or three Tylenol, but they barely take the edge off. I've also tried drinking more water and cutting back on caffeine, but it hasn't helped much. Last week, I had one headache that was so bad it made me feel nauseous, and I had to leave work early. I'm worried this might be something serious, like a tumor or something. My aunt had brain cancer a few years ago, and it started with headaches, so I'm a bit freaked out. I've never had migraines before, but could this be what they're like? Should I be concerned about my vision? I haven't noticed any changes, but I'm due for an eye exam anyway. Do you think I should come in for a check-up, or maybe get some tests done? I'd really appreciate your advice on this. Thanks for your time, Dr. Johnson."

    value: `Dear Dr. Garcia, I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out because I've been having some troubling symptoms lately that I'm not sure what to make of. For the past three weeks, I've been feeling really tired all the time, no matter how much sleep I get. I usually aim for 7-8 hours a night, but even after that, I wake up feeling exhausted. It's affecting my work at the construction site - I'm having trouble concentrating and feeling weak when I'm lifting materials. I've also noticed that I'm losing weight without trying. I've dropped about 10 pounds in the last month, even though I haven't changed my diet or exercise routine. In fact, I've been eating more than usual because I feel hungry all the time. Another strange thing is that I've been feeling really thirsty, drinking water constantly, and using the bathroom much more frequently than normal, especially at night. It's disrupting my sleep, having to get up 3-4 times to use the restroom. I've also noticed some blurry vision, particularly when I'm trying to read or look at my phone. At first, I thought it was just from being tired, but it's not going away. I don't have a family history of any major illnesses, but I'm worried this could be something serious. Could it be diabetes? Or maybe a thyroid problem? I've never had issues like this before. Should I come in for some tests? I appreciate any guidance you can provide. Thank you for your time and expertise.`,

    value: `Hello Dr. Patel, I hope I'm not bothering you, but I've been having some chest discomfort that's got me worried. It started about a week ago - I feel this tightness in my chest, kind of like someone's sitting on it. It comes and goes, but I've noticed it happens more when I'm walking up the stairs to my apartment or when I'm stressed at work. Sometimes it spreads to my left arm and I feel a bit of numbness there. The other day, while I was rushing to catch the bus, I got really short of breath and felt dizzy. I had to sit down for a few minutes before I felt okay again. I know I'm only 45, but my dad had a heart attack at 50, so I'm pretty anxious about this. I smoke about half a pack a day and I know I could stand to lose a few pounds. My job as a truck driver means I sit for long hours and don't get much exercise. I've been taking some antacids thinking it might be heartburn, but they don't seem to help much. My wife is really pushing me to get this checked out, especially since I've been feeling more tired than usual lately. Do you think this could be heart-related? Should I come in for an appointment, or do I need to go to the ER? I don't want to overreact, but I also don't want to ignore something serious. Thanks for your help, Dr. Patel.`,
