"Hi Dr. Johnson, I've been taking the new medication for 3 days now but the rash seems to be getting worse and spreading to my neck. Should I stop taking it or wait longer to see if it improves?"
"doctor my stomak hurts very bad since 2 days cannot eat anything only little water please help me what i do???"

"Reaching out because I noticed some unusual swelling in my ankles and feet over the past week. No pain, just puffiness that doesn't go away overnight. I'm on lisinopril for blood pressure. Is this something I should come in for?"

"Hello, I am writing to inform you that I have completed the recommended physical therapy sessions (total of 8) for my shoulder. While there has been moderate improvement in mobility, I continue to experience significant pain when lifting objects above shoulder height. Would it be appropriate to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss alternative treatment options? Thank you for your consideration."

"I need to reschedule tomorrows appt. My son is sick and I need to take care of him. What other times you have this week? After 3pm work better for me. Sorry for late notice."

"Good morning! Quick question - I noticed on my lab results my vitamin D level is 18 ng/mL which is flagged as low. I'm not sure what this means or if I should be concerned? Do I need to take supplements and if so, what dosage would you recommend? Thanks!"

"My daughter she have fever 102F from last night we give tylenol but come back fever after 4 hour. She not eating only drinking little. She 3 years. Please tell what we do?"

"I am experiencing severe chest discomfort and shortness of breath since approximately 4:30 this afternoon. The pain radiates to my left arm and jaw. I have taken one nitroglycerine tablet without relief. Given my history of coronary artery disease, should I proceed to the emergency department? I am reluctant to go if this is merely anxiety."

**Patient Message:**
"Good morning, Dr. Roberts, I hope this message finds you well and not too overwhelmed with your busy schedule. I've been meaning to reach out to you for quite some time now, probably for about two weeks or so, but you know how life gets sometimes—between taking my grandkids to their various activities (Tommy has soccer on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and little Sarah is doing ballet three times a week now, can you believe it?), and then there was that whole situation with our neighbor's tree falling partially into our yard during that windstorm last Wednesday—you might have seen it on the local news, it was quite the event in our neighborhood. Anyway, I've been experiencing this peculiar pain in my left knee, not my right knee, which has actually been feeling much better since you prescribed that cream last visit—that was a true blessing, by the way, and I've recommended it to my friend Martha who has similar issues—but my left knee has been making this odd clicking sound whenever I climb the stairs, particularly when I'm carrying something, like groceries or laundry. It doesn't hurt all the time, mostly in the mornings or if I've been sitting at my weekly bridge club for too long (we meet every Friday at the community center, and I usually bring my famous lemon squares, which everyone seems to enjoy tremendously). Sometimes the pain radiates a bit down my shin, especially if I've been walking at the mall, which I try to do three times a week for exercise, usually with my walking group—there are five of us ladies, all about the same age—and we typically walk for about 45 minutes, unless Doris is having one of her bad days with her hip, in which case we cut it short. So I was wondering if perhaps I should come in for an appointment to have you take a look at this knee situation, or if you think I should try something over-the-counter first? My sister-in-law suggested those glucosamine supplements that she swears by, but I wanted to check with you before starting anything new, since I'm already taking those blood pressure pills and the vitamin D you recommended at my annual checkup back in February—or was it March? It might have been March because I remember it was right after my youngest son's birthday."

**Summary:**
* Patient is experiencing pain and clicking in left knee, especially when climbing stairs
* Pain sometimes radiates down shin after walking
* Currently taking blood pressure medication and vitamin D
* Requesting advice on whether to schedule an appointment or try over-the-counter remedies first

**Patient Message:**
"Hi there Dr. Chen, I've been dealing with these headaches, well I'm not sure if they're actually headaches or migraines or what exactly, but they've been bothering me on and off for the past month or so, ever since I returned from that business trip to Chicago—which was exhausting by the way, with delayed flights and that conference where I had to give a presentation to over 200 people, talk about stressful! The pain usually starts right behind my right eye, not the left one, and then it kind of spreads around to the side of my head and sometimes down into my neck, making it really difficult to concentrate on my work (I've been really busy lately with this new project that my boss dumped on me last minute, typical of him not to give proper notice, but that's a whole other story that I won't bore you with right now). The headaches seem to be worse in the afternoons, especially on days when I've been staring at my computer screen for hours on end, which, unfortunately, is most days given my job in graphic design. I've tried taking Advil, usually two tablets, sometimes three if it's really bad, and occasionally it helps a little bit, but the relief doesn't last very long, maybe an hour or two at most, and then the pain comes creeping back. I've also tried those menthol rub sticks that my colleague Susan recommended—she swears by them for her tension headaches, and she gets them quite frequently due to her three teenagers at home who apparently never give her a moment's peace—but honestly, they just made my forehead feel tingly without actually addressing the pain. I've been trying to drink more water, because I read somewhere online that dehydration can cause headaches, so I bought this fancy new water bottle with time markers on it to remind me to drink throughout the day, though sometimes I forget to refill it when I'm in back-to-back meetings. I've also been attempting to reduce my screen time in the evenings by reading actual physical books instead of scrolling through social media on my phone, which my wife says is probably good for me anyway since she thinks I'm addicted to Instagram, which isn't entirely untrue I suppose. My sister, who's really into holistic medicine and has been seeing this naturopath for years, suggested it might be related to my diet and that I should try eliminating gluten or dairy or both, but that seems like a pretty drastic step to take without medical advice, which is why I'm finally messaging you about it. So basically, I'm wondering if this is something I should be concerned about or if there's any prescription medication that might be more effective than the over-the-counter stuff I've been trying with limited success?"

**Summary:**
* Experiencing headaches for about a month that start behind right eye and spread to side of head/neck
* Symptoms worse in afternoons after computer use
* Tried Advil and menthol rubs with limited, short-term relief
* Requesting assessment and possibly prescription medication options

## Example 3

**Patient Message:**
"Dear Dr. Williams, I trust this message reaches you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to you today regarding a rather persistent cough that has been plaguing me for approximately two and a half weeks now, beginning shortly after I attended my cousin Elaine's outdoor wedding in Westbrook (it was a lovely ceremony by the lake, though perhaps slightly too chilly for the season, and I distinctly remember thinking I should have brought an extra layer). The cough initially presented as a minor tickle in my throat, nothing too concerning at the time, as I assumed it was merely a reaction to the abundant pollen in the air at the wedding venue, given all the flowering trees and elaborate floral arrangements that the bride had specifically selected for the occasion (she's always been particularly fond of lilies, which were absolutely everywhere). However, as the days progressed, the cough developed into something more substantial, producing a small amount of clear mucus in the mornings—typically after I've had my first cup of coffee, which is part of my daily ritual, along with taking my multivitamin and calcium supplement that you recommended during my annual physical back in January. I should mention that I haven't experienced any significant fever throughout this ordeal, though I did notice a slight elevation in temperature, approximately 99.2 degrees Fahrenheit, last Tuesday evening after returning from my weekly pottery class, which does involve a rather poorly ventilated studio space that several of my fellow pottery enthusiasts have commented on in recent months. The cough tends to worsen considerably at night, particularly when I first lie down to sleep, causing quite a disturbance to both myself and my husband Richard, who has taken to sleeping in the guest bedroom on alternate nights just to get some uninterrupted rest (poor dear has that important presentation coming up at work next week, and he really does need his sleep to perform at his best). I've attempted various home remedies to alleviate the symptoms, including honey and lemon tea, which my grandmother always swore by, an over-the-counter cough syrup purchased from the pharmacy on Oak Street (the one near the new supermarket, not the one by the library that closed down last summer), and even those menthol cough drops that my neighbor Mrs. Peterson kindly dropped off when she heard me coughing through the open windows last weekend while she was walking her dachshund, Milo. None of these interventions have provided substantial relief, I'm afraid. I'm beginning to worry that this might be something more serious than a simple post-wedding cold, possibly bronchitis or perhaps even the beginning stages of pneumonia, though I certainly hope that's not the case given my planned trip to visit my daughter in San Francisco next month, which I've been looking forward to since Christmas, as she's expecting her first child—my first grandchild!—in early June."

**Summary:**
* Persistent cough for 2.5 weeks producing clear mucus in mornings
* No significant fever (slight elevation to 99.2°F once)
* Cough worsens at night when lying down
* Home remedies (honey/lemon tea, OTC cough syrup, menthol drops) not providing relief
* Concerned it might be bronchitis or pneumonia

## Example 4

**Patient Message:**
"Hola Dr. Martinez, I hope you are doing good today and not too busy with many patients. I am messaging about the pain in my back that is not going away since the accident at my work about 6 weeks ago, you remember? It was when I was lifting the heavy box in the storage room at the restaurant where I work, I am a cook there for 5 years now, and my boss he asked me to get some supplies from the storage and the box was very heavy with cans of tomatoes. When I tried to lift it, I felt something like 'pop' in my back and then much pain, very sharp, and I had to sit down right away on the floor. My coworker Miguel, he found me there and helped me to stand up and called our manager, who said I should go home and rest, but the next day I could not even get out of bed, the pain was so bad, so my wife called you and you told her I should go to urgent care, remember? So I went to urgent care and they give me the muscle relaxers and the pain medicine, I think it was called something like oxycodone? It helped a little bit but made me feel very strange in my head and sleepy all day, so I stopped taking it after three days, but I finished all the muscle relaxers. The doctor at urgent care said I should not work for two weeks, so I stayed home but it was very difficult because I am the only one working in my family right now since my wife lost her job at the hotel because of covid two years ago, and she is still looking for new job but it is hard to find, and we have the three children in school who need many things, books and clothes and food, of course. So after two weeks I went back to work even though my back was still hurting because we need the money for rent which is very expensive now, they raised it again last month, can you believe it? But now at work I cannot do all my normal jobs, I cannot lift the heavy things or stand for long time cooking, so my boss he is not happy with me and yesterday he said if I cannot do all my work soon he will need to find someone else who can, and I am very worried about this because like I said we need the money very much. The pain is still there every day, especially in the morning when I first get up and at night after working all day. It is in the lower part of my back, on the left side mostly, and sometimes it goes down my leg a little bit, like electricity feeling. I am taking the Advil, sometimes 4 pills at one time because 2 is not enough, and using the heating pad that my sister gave me, and also trying the exercises that I found on YouTube for back pain, but nothing is making it much better. Sometimes I cannot sleep because of the pain, and when I cannot sleep I worry more about the work and the money and this makes everything worse. So I am wondering if maybe I need stronger medicine or maybe I need the MRI test to see what is happening inside my back? Or maybe I should see the special back doctor? I don't know what to do, but I need to fix this problem soon because I cannot lose my job, doctor, it would be very bad for my family."

**Summary:**
* Work-related back injury from lifting heavy box 6 weeks ago
* Lower back pain (left side) sometimes radiating down leg
* Previously prescribed muscle relaxers (completed) and oxycodone (stopped after 3 days)
* Currently taking Advil (sometimes 4 at once), using heating pad, and trying exercises
* Unable to perform full job duties and at risk of losing employment
* Requesting stronger medication, MRI, or specialist referral

## Example 5

**Patient Message:**
"Hello Dr. Thompson, I'm writing to you about my ongoing digestive issues, which I first mentioned to you during my appointment about three months ago, if you recall—that was the appointment where we also discussed my cholesterol levels, which were slightly elevated, and you suggested I try to incorporate more fiber and omega-3s into my diet and perhaps take up swimming, which I have actually started doing at the community pool near my office, usually on Monday and Wednesday mornings before work, though sometimes I have to skip if I have an early meeting, which has been happening more frequently since our department underwent restructuring last month. Regarding the digestive problems, I've been keeping that food diary you recommended (I've been quite diligent about it, writing down everything I eat and drink and noting any symptoms that follow, which my wife thinks is a bit obsessive, but I told her you said it was important to track patterns), and I've noticed that the bloating and discomfort seem to occur most frequently after meals containing dairy products, particularly cheese and ice cream, which is rather disappointing as I've always been quite fond of both—I've been known to indulge in a bowl of mint chocolate chip almost every weekend since college, a habit I picked up from my roommate who went on to become a professional chef, interestingly enough. The symptoms typically begin about 30-45 minutes after eating these foods and include a feeling of fullness and distension in my abdomen, occasional cramping (usually on the lower left side), and sometimes increased gas, which, as you can imagine, makes for some awkward situations during my weekly staff meetings that I'm required to lead. I've tried taking those over-the-counter lactase enzyme supplements before consuming dairy—the ones my mother-in-law recommended, as she's had similar issues for years—but they seem to only partially alleviate the symptoms, reducing their severity rather than eliminating them completely. I've also attempted to cut back significantly on dairy, substituting almond milk in my morning coffee and oatmeal, though I find the taste less satisfying, and trying those plant-based cheese alternatives, which, frankly, leave much to be desired in terms of texture and flavor, despite what the enthusiastic grocery store employee assured me when she recommended them. Additionally, I've been experiencing some acid reflux, particularly at night when I'm trying to sleep, which has been affecting my rest quality and leaving me somewhat fatigued during the day, just when I need to be most alert for work, especially now that I'm overseeing two additional team members following the aforementioned departmental restructuring. I've been propping myself up with extra pillows and avoiding eating within three hours of bedtime, as suggested by a health article I read in that magazine in your waiting room during my last visit, but the reflux still occurs at least a couple of times per week. So I'm wondering if these symptoms might indicate some form of lactose intolerance that's developed in my middle age, or perhaps something more concerning like irritable bowel syndrome or even a hiatal hernia? My aunt on my mother's side was diagnosed with celiac disease in her fifties, though I don't recall her mentioning similar symptoms to what I'm experiencing. Should I consider eliminating dairy completely from my diet, or would it be worthwhile to undergo some specific testing to determine the exact nature of these digestive issues? And is there a prescription medication that might be more effective than the over-the-counter options I've tried thus far?"

**Summary:**
* Ongoing digestive issues with bloating and discomfort, particularly after consuming dairy products
* Symptoms include abdominal distension, cramping (lower left side), and increased gas starting 30-45 minutes after eating
* OTC lactase enzymes only partially helpful
* Also experiencing acid reflux at night despite elevating head and avoiding late meals
* Has maintained food diary as previously recommended
* Requesting diagnosis (possibly lactose intolerance), testing options, and prescription medication recommendations
